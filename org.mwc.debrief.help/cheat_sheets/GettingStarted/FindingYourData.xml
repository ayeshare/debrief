	<intro>
		<description>Debrief NG stores it&apos;s data in a local folder called a Project. While
			these are frequently created afresh to store new analysis data, it&apos;s also possible
			to denote your existing data directories as sub-folders (via links). This tutorial leads
			you through generating links to your existing data folders. But, if the "Create Project" 
			form opened at application startup, you
			provided a project name, and indicated that you would like sample data to be imported,
			then you can skip the following steps and move on to the next cheat sheet.
			<br/>
			You should also skip this set of tasks if you can see a <b>Sample Data</b> folder in your Navigator,
			since you must have already created the necessary link(s).
			<br/>
			Lastly, you should skip this set of tasks if you run Debrief from a network share.  The 
			next set of tasks (for <b>shared folder</b>) are the correct set for your situation. </description>

	<item skip="true" title="Open Navigator if it is closed">
		<description>Open <b>Navigator</b> if it is closed by using the <b>Ctrl+3</b> shortcut and
			then either clicking on the option in <b>Previous Choices</b> or typing
			&apos;navigator&apos; in the search field and clicking on it when it appears.

	<item skip="true" title="Check you have a workspace">
		<description>Before you can link existing data, you need to define a project for your work:
			a &apos;project&apos; is a parent folder which stores your links. If your <b>Navigator</b> view is empty,
			you must first complete the <b>Generating a project for your data</b> cheat-sheet (above).

	<item skip="true" title="Add a new Folder">
		<description>
			To add a new folder:
			<br/><b>1.</b> Right-click on your current project in the <b>Navigator</b> view, the <b>New</b> sub-menu will show.
			<br/><b>2.</b> Select <b>Folder</b> and the <b>New Folder</b> wizard will open.
			<br/>Here though, instead of creating a fresh child folder to store our data, we&apos;re going to link to an existing folder.
			<br/><b>3.</b> In the <b>New Folder</b> wizard, click on the <b>Advanced</b> button and the <b>Advanced</b> options will show.
			<br/><b>4.</b> Select <b>Link to alternate location (Linked folder)</b>.
			<br/><b>5.</b> Click on the <b>Browse...</b> button and navigate to an existing data folder on your machine or network location.
			<br/><b>6.</b> Once complete, click on <b>Finish</b> to close the wizard and link to your existing data.
			<br/><b>Note:</b> if you don&apos;t have your own data, use either of the following:
			<br/><b>•</b> For a deployed Debrief, use the <b>sample_data</b> folder installed in your Debrief installation folder.
			<br/><b>•</b> If you are running a development version of Debrief, use <b>org.mwc.cmap.combined.feature/root_installs</b>.
			<br/>If you followed these steps, you will have created a link to the sample data, however, if you need to load data from other data directories, repeat this process as often as is required, but use a shared working folder.
