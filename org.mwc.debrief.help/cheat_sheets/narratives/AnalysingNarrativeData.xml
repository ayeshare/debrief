<cheatsheet title="Analysing narrative data" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="..\contentFile.xsd">
	<intro>
		<description>In addition to geospatial data, Debrief offers the ability to analyse time-stamped textual comments - referred to as Narrative data.  Narrative data is shown in its own view, and is displayed dynamically in association with the current exercise time.</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Check you have some data" skip="true">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window.  If it isn&apos;t there, select "Navigator" from Debrief&apos;s Window/Show View menu.  Also check you have our sample data-files - it they&apos;re not there, find how to load them from the "Loading sample data" cheat-sheet.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Open the sample plot-file">
		<description>Double-click on &apos;sample.dpf&apos; in the Navigator window, and the sample plot will open.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Fit to window" href="\org.mwc.debrief.help\html\legacy\moving_around.html#Fit_To_Win">
		<description>To make sure all of the data is visible, click on the "Fit-to-Window" toolbar button.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Load narrative data">
		<description>Now return to the Navigator window and drag the "narrative.rep" file onto the current plot.  No, you probably won&apos;t see anything change (unless you have the Outline View open)</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Inspect narrative data">
		<description>If the Outline View isn&apos;t open yet, open it.  You&apos;ll see a new item shown, "Narratives (19 items)".  This shows that Debrief has loaded 19 narrative items.  No, you can&apos;t see any change on the plot, but that&apos;s because narrative data doesn&apos;t have a geographic location.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Open Narrative Viewer">
		<description>Now open the Narrative Viewer from the "Window/Show View" drop-down menu.
		</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Familiarise with Narrative Viewer" href="/org.mwc.debrief.help/html/legacy/view_narrative.html">
		<description>So, you should now see four columns.  These indicate the date of the comment, the origin of the comment, the type of comment (if recorded in the original data-file), and the comment itself.  Read more about the narrative viewer by clicking the help icon (above).</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Track exercise time">
		<description>Now try dragging the slider in Debrief&apos;s Time Controller.  You will see a highlight move through the narrative data, indicating the narrative entry nearest to the current DTG.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Control exercise time">
		<description>Beyond following exercise time, narrative data can control exercise time.  To illustrate this, just double-click on a narrative entry, and you&apos;ll see both the time controller and the plot highlight jump to the relevant time.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Add a bookmark">
		<description>Similar to the previous encounter with bookmarks (via the Time Controller), it is possible to add a bookmark directly from a narrative entry.  If a narrative entry is of great significance to your navigation through the time period, click on the entry and select &quot;Add DTG as bookmark&quot; from the Narrative view&apos;s pull down menu (top-right).  The bookmark description will be populated with the narrative entry - but feel free to edit it if applicable.  The bookmark can now be found in the &quot;Bookmarks&quot; view, even after you&apos;ve closed the current plot.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Done">
		<description>That&apos;s it for narrative data.  It&apos;s not a significant part of Debrief anaylsis, but if you do receive good quality command narrative data (or other non geospatial data) then it may just prove useful.</description>
	</item>
